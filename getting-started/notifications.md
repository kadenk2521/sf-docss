# Customizing Your Notifications

Staying on top of Shadow Flips can feel overwhelming if you’re new to Discord, especially with so many channels and pings. Luckily, Discord gives you powerful tools to control what notifications you see, both at the **server level** and **channel level**. Here’s a full guide to customizing your Shadow Flips experience.

***

### Finding Notification Settings

To open your notification controls:

1. Go to the Shadow Flips server.
2. Click the server name in the top-left corner, or right-click the server icon.
3. Select **Notification Settings** from the drop-down menu.

This will open the main notification menu, where you can customize alerts across the whole server or on individual channels.

### Server-Wide Mute

Want total silence? Instead of muting channels one by one, you can check **Mute Server**.

* This mutes _every channel_ in Shadow Flips.
* @everyone mentions will still get through.
* Mobile push notifications are disabled while the server is muted.

Keep in mind, this is an “all or nothing” option—it doesn’t let you pick and choose.

### Server Notification Settings

If you don’t want a full mute, you can fine-tune how you get alerts:

* **All Messages** → You’ll get notified for every message in every channel.
* **Only @mentions** → You’ll only be notified if someone tags you.
* **Nothing** → No notifications unless you specifically override a channel.

Extra options:

* **Suppress @everyone and @here** → Stops those mass mentions from pinging you.
* **Mobile Push Notifications** → Sends server notifications as push alerts to your phone if you’re logged into the same account.

### Channel Notification Settings

Sometimes you only want to tweak certain channels instead of the whole server.

* Under **Notification Overrides**, you’ll see a list of channels.
* You can mute channels individually, or adjust them to “All Messages,” “@mentions,” or “Nothing.”
* This lets you silence channels you don’t care about, while still keeping alerts active for the ones you use most.
